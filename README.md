# Scoring-Counties

Abstract

This project explores the use case of considering opening a business with a physical location 

We first gather census data at the county level. We look at population, domestic and international migration, household income, age distribution, types of businesses, annual payroll of businesses reported to the county and house prices

Using a csv of storage facilities pulled from Google Places API we count number of storage facilities by county and merge it with our census data. 

Finally, we identify 2 approaches of modeling and choose the one that fits our use case.
